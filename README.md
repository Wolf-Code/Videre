# Videre
A simple, yet effective video player.

## WPF
Using WPF instead of Windows Forms allows for easy styling and a more unique look, rather than yet another WinForms program.

## Support
As Videre uses the VLC libraries via [xZune.VLC](https://github.com/higankanshi/xZune.Vlc) to open media files, it supports as many file formats as VLC does. Which is a lot.

## Subtitles
Although Videre currently only supports the SubRip (*.srt) file format for subtitle files, it also has built-in support for OpenSubtitles.org.

### OpenSubtitles.org
OpenSubtitles.org is a website and service where you can find subtitle files for any movie or series. Videre has built-in support for this service,
allowing you to download subtitles files for your media. It uses a hash for the media file to find subtitle files which, according to the users on
OpenSubtitles.org, perfectly matches your specific media file.

## Themes
As Videre uses [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro), colour themes are built-in.
